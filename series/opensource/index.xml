      <description>So, you have finally convinced yourself to enter the realm of Open Source Development. But wait, the initial threshold of getting to speed in this domain is feeling too difficult for you. You are struggling to do your very first contribution in a big Open-Source repository. The huge code-base is too overwhelming and difficult to understand. The issues marked as simple are also too difficult to comprehend. There are just too many things you still don&amp;rsquo;t know. The list of things you are seeing for the first time is growing day by day. It seems it&amp;rsquo;s a bad choice after all?
So my dear open-sorcerer, have some hope. This feeling is mutual with at-least 60% of the people out there. It always starts with a bumpy road but if you can cross that part, believe me, the road ahead is smoother than you can imagine.
I started with OSS on 15th Sept with zero knowledge of this domain, I just knew some of the features of GitHub GUI. My first PR was to NLTK on 22nd Sept and for that whole week, I was struggling to just get my first PR in. The issue tracker and the vast code-base to work on was not intuitive enough to get past that threshold.</description>

      <title>Why I started Open-Source</title>

      <description>After more than 6 months into this, this question almost seems silly to me&amp;hellip; I remember the first week of September 2018, I was desperate to find just a single good enough reason for convincing me to contribute to the Open-Source community. I wanted to participate in GSoC but the idea of spending my own personal time into someone else project was not convincing me. Even after this, something changed and convinced me to do so. I hope by the end of it, you too will be convinced or at least give it a thought!!
Back in those days, I was exploring the depths of Deep Learning. My interest was divided among the most exciting domains popular those days. But somehow NLP was the top one. It was fascinating and enough to keep me there. The same year, two of my seniors became the first batch to crack GSoC from my college. I can say, it totally sparked hope in others.
I remember the day 15th September, I decided I too want it and started preparing for it. I know it was way too early to aim for it, but at that time I was familiar only with some markdown syntax and basic GitHub interface.</description>
