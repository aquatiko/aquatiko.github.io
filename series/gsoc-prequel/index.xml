      <description>PR info. 7th PR on AstroImages.jl. My first PR to JuliaAstro org. Task: Add a feature to change brightness/contrast of AstroImages in real-time in Jupyter notebook itself. Things used: Interact.jl for interactive Jupyter visualization.
Back-story There was a criterion of OpenAstronomy that a student should have at least one PR to the project to be eligible for getting selected into the org. Our mentor Mose told us about this and as AstroImages.jl was a new package, there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough issues to solve. So he came up with this idea that can be implemented to the package. Lucky me, I have done the same thing before while extending docs of Images.jl. I think this gave me an edge over others. Those days I was also contributing to JuliaText, so managing time for both org. was tuff. But as I knew how to do this, it was a quick PR.
PR evaluation and learnings Mose was expecting the same thing which I had made. I also proposed some ideas like we can store this operation and change the data of FITS if the user wants according to this feature. But Mose highlighted that the data is holy, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just modify it just carelessly.</description>
