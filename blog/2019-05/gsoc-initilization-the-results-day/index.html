<p><img name="GSoC_Initialization" src="https://aquatiko.github.io/GSoC_Initialization.jpg" width='1500px'/></p>

<p>The day 6th of March 2019 will always be remembered when dreams actually came true.</p>

<p>We were having our end semester exams and results were going to be displayed at 11:30 PM according to our time-zone. We had the last exam tomorrow at 4 pm and the pressure of GSoC was intense. I came to my hostel dorm after finishing the 4 pm exam that day and I had to study for the last one. I have submitted two proposals for GSoC, one for JuliaText in JuliaLang and other to JuliaAstro in OpenAstronomy. I have worked equally for both of them, maybe a bit more for JuliaText&rsquo;s NLP one. I had an assurance that one of them might get in as I gave my all for them. Strict personal deadlines, iteration of thoughts and planning the best possible ways to strengthen my proposal.</p>

<p>So, I started studying for the last exam around 7-8pm and at the start, I wasn&rsquo;t feeling the pressure of GSoC that much. And as time passed, minutes seemed like hours and the panic grew stronger. I just couldn&rsquo;t wait till 11:30 PM. So, I was in a state where I couldn&rsquo;t focus enough to let that thought go away and study for the last exam. I had the feeling that, can&rsquo;t the result be a day after, why destiny wants them to coincide? Just Why?</p>

<p>Fast forward to 11 PM, I had to hide all the clocks from my site to study. But as they say, the internal clock was ticking loud with all sort of raging thoughts.</p>

<p>The clock struck 11:30 PM and I rushed to GSoC&rsquo;s site. I typed the letters &ldquo;Ro&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>No results shown, my heart skipped a beat!!</p>

<p>I went ahead, searched my name &ldquo;Rohit Kumar&rdquo;, and there it was. My name and My project.
<img name="result" src="https://aquatiko.github.io/result.png" width='1500px'/></p>

<p>I screamed in joy, &ldquo;Bhai GSoC ho gya&rdquo; (I am selected for GSoC) to my friend sitting beside me. I stayed there for a minute to let that sink in. Joy took over fear and anxiety a minute ago. A distant dream 6 months ago, finally within my grasp. Next, was the status update for all my batchmates and friends waiting for my results. Followed their congratulations. I am writing all this because it still needs to sink in a little, even today.</p>

<p>After all of that, I went to sleep and then I saw a mail from my mentor of JuliaText which wasn&rsquo;t selected for GSoC. The mail was an invitation for Julia Seasons of Contribution (JSoC). My joy doubled. Of course, I can&rsquo;t sleep that night. But I managed 2 hrs of it and the next morning I had to study for the last exam. I absolutely couldn&rsquo;t, Who could at this point?
I managed the exam somehow, the paper was relatively easier than I thought.</p>

<p>In the end, all that hard work was rewarded more than my expectation.
GSoC and JSoC!!</p>

<p>As per GSoC rules, I officially can&rsquo;t do both. But, I was so happy with both of my proposal being selected!!</p>

<p>The rest will be an exciting journey with OpenAstronomy!!</p>
